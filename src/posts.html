      Hey! I will soon set up a local Raspberry PI server and I think I should document the process here. So stay tuned!

      Also today I was able to install ZSH and it's pretty amazing. I'm not super confident yet but I feel like I can get used to this fancy shell.

      In this blog I will focus on my development journy focusing on programming and linux stuff.
      I recently purchused a Thinkpad T480 just for this purpose. Obviously the site is going to be open source.
