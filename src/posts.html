        Hey everyone! I'm happy to anouce the start of my new blog. 
      </p>

      <p>
        In this blog I will focus on my development journy focusing on programming and linux stuff. 
        I recently purchused a Thinkpad T480 just for this purpose. Obviously the site is going to be open source. 
        So you can see how it evolves over time. Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
